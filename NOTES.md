## What I implemented
 - Set up database connection string
 - Added CORS policy to allow frontend requests
 - Added task DTOs for create and retrieve operations
 - Added task service to separate task-related business logic from the controller
 - Updated `TasksController` to use `TasksService`
 - Created frontend CRUD functions for tasks
 - Integrated CRUD functions with the task UI
 - Added styling

## Whatâ€™s missing
- User-facing error notification
- Additional UX features (filtering, sorting, etc.)
